This is the code for the CVPR paper: Learning Neural Representation of Camera Pose with Matrix Representation of Pose Shift via View Synthesis.
In each folder is the code for each dataset. 

We include the instruction on each dataset in each folder.

The requirements.txt includes all of our package version.
We use python 3.6.8 and cuda 10.0
One can use conda to create an environment:

conda create -n py36 python=3.6.8
conda activate py36
pip install -r requirements.txt
